# Status

The app is already rather stable, so basic stuff should work.  
Project roadmap with planned features and approximate schedule is on [TODO](https://github.com/keeweb/keeweb/wiki/TODO) page.

# Self-hosting

Everything you need to host this app on your server is any static file server. The app is a single HTML file + cache manifest (optionally; for offline access).
You can download the latest distribution files from [gh-pages](https://github.com/keeweb/keeweb/archive/gh-pages.zip) branch.  

If you are using Docker:

1. put your dh.pem, cert.pem, key.pem to /etc/nginx/external/ 
2. run this script:
```bash
docker run --name keeweb -d -p 443:443 -p 80:80 -v $EXT_DIR:/etc/nginx/external/ antelle/keeweb
```

# Building

The easiest way to clone all KeeWeb repos is:
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keeweb/keeweb/develop/dev-env.sh | bash -
```

The app can be built with grunt: `grunt` (html file will be in `dist/`).    
Desktop apps are built with `grunt desktop`. This works only in macOS as it builds dmg; requires wine.  
Also, a hardware token is required.  
To run Electron app without building an installer, build the app with `grunt` and start it this way:
```bash
grunt dev
npm run-script electron
```

For debug build:

1. run `grunt dev`
2. open `http://localhost:8085/tmp`
